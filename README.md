# This is a DIY automatic cat litter box.

## Strong points:
1. Battery powered.
   It is using an NRF52832, standby on 6x18650 batteries is about a Year. Real life usage with 4 cats allowed for 3 months between charging, 400 clean cycles.
2. Removable sand scoop part.
   The part that scoops the sand is one hand removable, very siple cleaning/maintaining.
3. Waterproof.
   It s based on a servo, the battery holds in place using a magnet, can be taken off, and everything else can be places under running water.
4. Silent mechanism.
   It uses a servo and a stadard 10mm bit and screw, cut at the side for top loading, no squeaking sounds, nothing can get stuck in there.
5. Failproof safety.
   Besides the logic, is also uses the powerbank module to cut off power in a case of overload, the servo is then released, there is no way to harm a cat.

It runs on espruino.
